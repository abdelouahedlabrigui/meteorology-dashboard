OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a consistent trend of large-scale rainfall and snowstorms. The precipitation will be lighter and drier than average.
,


The main weather pattern is the cluster 0 cluster. Cluster 0 is a very strong cluster with a strong wind-driven downdraft. The peak temperatures will be around 18°C.


Clusters 1 and 2 are not as strong as cluster 1 and cluster 2. The cluster 1 is a moderate cluster with relatively weak winds. The clusters 2 are a moderate and strong cluster. The temperatures will remain higher than average, but the humidity will be less than average and the rainfall will be light.

 of the cluster 1 cluster, the humidity is a little higher than the average of cluster 2, which is also a moderate weather pattern.

,

The cluster 2 cluster is a strong cluster and the temperature will be above average. The humidity will reach over 99% of the average.

Expert Analysis:
the transition between winter and summer.
 and Winter-summer

The winter pattern includes a cool phase and a warm phase. In winter, the air mass transitions to the colder side, which is warmer than the warm side. The air mass then returns to the warm phase in the middle of summer, and the air masses of the cold side and warm side remain.
 in Winter-winter
